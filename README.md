####Explanation####

Here you will find all necessary homework files for my participation in the SMU MSDS program. Topics will be updated over time,
but currently only material related to unit 4 assignment will be posted. This readme will be updated later with more information as
content is added and this file will serve as a basic explanatory resource.

###Unit4###

For the "unit4" folder, data is taken from fivethirtyeight for the assignment. Inside you'll find a knitted file as well as an rmarkdown
file for the required assignment.
